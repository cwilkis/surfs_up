# surfs_up

## Overview
I was asked to analyze the weather patterns in Oahu, HI to determin if a surf and ice cream shop was feasible for year round sales. The owner was particularly concerned about June and December, as the temperatures fluctuate more those months. 

## Results
For the months of June, I create different tables in order to retrieve the temperatures for each day of the month over seveeral years. I then averaged them out using pandas dataframes. December and June have similar average temperatures, 71 and 74 degrees, respectively. 

## Summary
Using the same dataframes, I was able to show the average temperatures, as well as the max temperatures. Based on the tables, June and December have very similar temperatures, which would make the year round surf shop feasible due to the stable temperatures throughout the differing months.
